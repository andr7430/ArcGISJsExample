# ArcGISJsExample
An Example to use the ArcGIS Javascript API 4.0 with MeteorJS

## Introduction ##

This is a very simple application created with the ArcGIS JavaScript API 4.0 (Beta 1) for the MeteorJS framework.

This projects has the following dependencies:

* iron:router
* miro:preloader

optional:
* jquery
* Bootstrap

And of course ArcGIS Javascript API.

Because of the require structure structure used by the ArcGIS library, you will need to use the miro:preloader.
Since Javascript Samples are also written with the help of JQuery and Bootstrap, I have also included the 2 libraries.
